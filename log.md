# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Got the django server running; successful in giving curl command.

**Thoughts:** Was at my wit's end trying to figure out why it shows an internal server error (500) when debug is set to false and a MultiValueDictKeyError when DEBUG=TRUE; it appears curl tool in Windows makes a different request than curl tool in Mac.

### Day 1: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Android app to send data to django server

**Thoughts**: Basic functionality successfully coded, but not making any headway with the failed GET requests.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
